# Maintenance Guide: Larkhall Athletic Fixtures Calendar

This document provides comprehensive guidance for the ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting of the Larkhall Athletic Fixtures Calendar system.

## Routine Maintenance

### Daily Operations

The calendar is designed to update automatically via GitHub Actions, but these checks should be performed regularly:

1. **Verify Update Success**
   - Check GitHub Actions logs for successful completion
   - Confirm that the fixtures.ics file has been updated
   - Verify that the calendar content is current and accurate

2. **Monitor API Health**
   - Watch for any API errors in the logs
   - Confirm that fixture data is being retrieved successfully
   - Check for any changes in API response format

### Weekly Tasks

1. **Calendar Validation**
   - Subscribe to the calendar in a test environment
   - Verify that all upcoming fixtures are displayed correctly
   - Check for any formatting or display issues

2. **Error Log Review**
   - Review GitHub Actions logs for warnings or errors
   - Address any recurring issues
   - Document any workarounds implemented

### Monthly Tasks

1. **Dependency Review**
   - Check for updates to key dependencies
   - Test any updates in a development environment before deploying
   - Update requirements.txt as needed

2. **Documentation Review**
   - Ensure all documentation is current
   - Update procedures based on any process changes
   - Review and refresh troubleshooting guides

3. **Performance Assessment**
   - Check GitHub Actions execution time
   - Verify calendar file size remains reasonable
   - Assess API response times

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### API Connection Problems

#### Symptoms
- GitHub Actions workflow fails during API request
- Error messages related to HTTP requests
- Empty or incomplete fixture data

#### Resolution Steps
1. Verify API key is valid and correctly configured in GitHub Secrets
2. Check API endpoint status with a manual request
3. Review API documentation for any changes to endpoints or parameters
4. Implement retry logic if not already present
5. Contact API provider if issues persist

### Calendar Format Issues

#### Symptoms
- Calendar applications reject the .ics file
- Events display incorrectly in calendar applications
- Missing or malformed event details

#### Resolution Steps
1. Validate the .ics file against RFC 5545 standards
2. Check for any non-standard characters or formatting
3. Verify date/time formats are correct and include timezone information
4. Test with multiple calendar applications to isolate the issue
5. Review the iCalendar library documentation for proper usage

### GitHub Actions Failures

#### Symptoms
- Workflow shows failed status
- Calendar not updating automatically
- Error messages in workflow logs

#### Resolution Steps
1. Check workflow logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that all required secrets are configured
3. Confirm that the Python environment is set up correctly
4. Test the update script locally to identify issues
5. Check GitHub status page for any service disruptions

### Data Accuracy Issues

#### Symptoms
- Missing fixtures in the calendar
- Incorrect fixture details (time, venue, opponent)
- Outdated information not being refreshed

#### Resolution Steps
1. Manually check the API response for the expected data
2. Verify that the data processing logic is extracting all relevant information
3. Check for any filtering that might be excluding valid fixtures
4. Confirm that postponed or rescheduled matches are handled correctly
5. Update the data processing logic if needed

## System Recovery

### Handling Failed Updates

If an update fails, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Cause**
   - Review GitHub Actions logs
   - Check for API errors or data processing issues
   - Determine if it's a temporary or persistent problem

2. **Temporary Fix**
   - Manually trigger the workflow after resolving the issue
   - If needed, manually update the fixtures.ics file

3. **Long-term Resolution**
   - Update the code to handle the specific failure case
   - Add additional error handling or logging
   - Implement more robust recovery mechanisms

### Rollback Procedure

If a problematic update needs to be reverted:

1. **Identify the Last Good Version**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline fixtures.ics
   ```

2. **Revert to Previous Version**
   ```bash
   git checkout [commit-hash] -- fixtures.ics
   git commit -m "Rollback calendar to previous working version"
   git push
   ```

3. **Fix the Underlying Issue**
   - Address the root cause in the update script
   - Test thoroughly before re-enabling automatic updates

## System Improvements

### Performance Optimization

1. **Reduce API Calls**
   - Implement caching for API responses
   - Only update the calendar when changes are detected
   - Use conditional requests if supported by the API

2. **Optimize Calendar File**
   - Remove unnecessary properties or events
   - Limit the date range of included fixtures
   - Compress the file if size becomes an issue

### Reliability Enhancements

1. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Add more comprehensive try/except blocks
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Add detailed logging for troubleshooting

2. **Monitoring Improvements**
   - Set up notifications for failed updates
   - Implement health checks for the calendar
   - Create dashboards for system status

### Feature Additions

When considering new features, evaluate them against these criteria:

1. **Maintenance Impact**
   - Will the feature increase maintenance complexity?
   - Is the feature sustainable long-term?

2. **User Benefit**
   - Does the feature provide significant value to users?
   - Will it improve the calendar experience?

3. **Implementation Complexity**
   - Can the feature be implemented reliably?
   - Are there dependencies on external services?

## Documentation Updates

Keep the following documentation updated as the system evolves:

1. **Code Comments**
   - Ensure all functions and complex logic are well-documented
   - Update comments when code changes

2. **README and Setup Instructions**
   - Keep installation and configuration steps current
   - Update troubleshooting guides based on user experiences

3. **Maintenance Procedures**
   - Document any new maintenance tasks
   - Update recovery procedures as needed
