   - Verify GitHub Pages settings in repository configuration
   - Ensure correct branch is selected (main)
   - Ensure root directory is set as publishing source
   - Check for any build errors in Actions tab

2. Test public deployment
   - Confirm calendar updates automatically (GitHub Actions now working)
   - Test subscription URL once GitHub Pages is accessible
   - Test QR code functionality

### Short-Term (Next 3-5 Days)

1. Verify deployment
   - Test public URL access
   - Verify automated updates
   - Monitor first update cycles

2. Test subscription
   - Subscribe to calendar on multiple platforms
   - Verify event display
   - Check update propagation
   - Test with QR code and simplified guide

3. Improve user accessibility
   - Share QR code and subscription guide with Larkhall supporters
   - Consider creating printable materials for match days
   - Explore options for integration with club website or social media

### Medium-Term (Next 2-4 Weeks)

1. Monitor and refine
   - Track update reliability
   - Address any issues
   - Optimize performance

2. Gather user feedback
   - Identify improvement opportunities
   - Address usability concerns
   - Implement minor enhancements

## Open Questions

1. **API Reliability**: How reliable is the FootballWebPages API in practice? Are there rate limits or downtime periods?
   - Initial testing shows good reliability, but long-term monitoring is needed

2. **Data Completeness**: Does the API provide all necessary fixture information consistently?
   - API provides comprehensive fixture information including dates, times, venues, and competition details

3. **Calendar Client Behavior**: How quickly do different calendar applications sync with subscription updates?
   - To be determined during subscription testing

4. **Edge Cases**: How well does the implementation handle postponed or cancelled fixtures?
   - Implementation includes status handling for cancelled and postponed fixtures, but real-world testing is needed

## Current Blockers

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: âœ… Resolved
   - Permission issues fixed
   - Automated updates now working correctly

2. **GitHub Pages Configuration**: Comprehensive fixes implemented
   - Implemented multiple solutions to address 404 error:
     - Created .nojekyll file to disable Jekyll processing
     - Added _config.yml with explicit Jekyll configuration
     - Created dedicated GitHub Pages workflow (.github/workflows/pages.yml)
     - Added test.md file to verify deployment
     - Updated documentation with detailed troubleshooting steps
   - Next steps:
     - Monitor GitHub Actions workflow for the Pages deployment
     - Verify site accessibility after changes propagate
     - Check if test.md is accessible as an indicator of successful deployment

3. **Subscription Testing**: Partially unblocked
   - Created QR code and simplified guide for easier subscription
   - Still need public URL to be accessible for full testing
   - Can test with direct file subscription as workaround
