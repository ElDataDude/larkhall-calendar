# Active Context: Larkhall Athletic Fixtures Calendar

## Current Work Focus

As of March 28, 2025, the project is **ready for deployment**. The current focus is on:

1. **Deployment to GitHub Pages**
   - Creating the GitHub repository
   - Configuring GitHub Pages
   - Setting up the API key as a repository secret
   - Testing the public URL

2. **Subscription Testing**
   - Testing subscription across different platforms
   - Ensuring calendar compatibility
   - Verifying update mechanisms

3. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Monitoring the automated updates
   - Addressing any issues that arise
   - Gathering user feedback

## Recent Decisions

1. **Technology Stack Selection**
   - **Decision**: Use Python with requests and icalendar libraries
   - **Rationale**: Simplicity, readability, and strong library support
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Node.js, PHP
   - **Status**: Implemented

2. **Hosting Platform**
   - **Decision**: GitHub Pages
   - **Rationale**: Free, reliable, integrated with GitHub Actions
   - **Alternatives Considered**: AWS S3, Netlify
   - **Status**: Configured, pending repository creation

3. **Update Frequency**
   - **Decision**: Daily updates via GitHub Actions
   - **Rationale**: Balance between timeliness and resource usage
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Hourly, weekly
   - **Status**: Implemented in workflow configuration

4. **Calendar Format**
   - **Decision**: Standard iCalendar (.ics) format
   - **Rationale**: Universal compatibility with calendar applications
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Custom JSON API, Google Calendar integration
   - **Status**: Implemented

5. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - **Decision**: Comprehensive try/except blocks with logging
   - **Rationale**: Ensure robustness against API failures
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Simple error reporting
   - **Status**: Implemented

6. **User Interface**
   - **Decision**: Simple HTML landing page with subscription instructions
   - **Rationale**: Easy access for non-technical users
   - **Alternatives Considered**: No UI, just raw .ics file
   - **Status**: Implemented

## Active Considerations

1. **API Response Handling**
   - **Issue**: Complete structure of the API response confirmed
   - **Approach**: Tested with real API calls and updated code accordingly
   - **Status**: Completed and validated

2. **Fixture Information Completeness**
   - **Issue**: All relevant fixture details are being captured
   - **Approach**: Analyzed real API responses and refined data extraction
   - **Status**: Implemented and validated

3. **Error Handling Robustness**
   - **Issue**: System handles potential failure modes
   - **Approach**: Implemented comprehensive error handling
   - **Status**: Implemented, ready for real-world testing

4. **Calendar Subscription Testing**
   - **Issue**: Ensuring compatibility across different calendar applications
   - **Approach**: Testing with major platforms (Google, Apple, Outlook)
   - **Status**: Ready for testing with public URL

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 1-2 Days)

1. Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Create GitHub repository
   - Push code to repository
   - Configure GitHub Pages
   - Set up API key as repository secret

2. Test public deployment
   - Verify GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully
   - Confirm calendar updates automatically
   - Test subscription URL

### Short-Term (Next 3-5 Days)

1. Verify deployment
   - Test public URL access
   - Verify automated updates
   - Monitor first update cycles

2. Test subscription
   - Subscribe to calendar on multiple platforms
   - Verify event display
   - Check update propagation

3. Document findings
   - Update documentation with real-world observations
   - Document any workarounds or special considerations
   - Finalize user instructions

### Medium-Term (Next 2-4 Weeks)

1. Monitor and refine
   - Track update reliability
   - Address any issues
   - Optimize performance

2. Gather user feedback
   - Identify improvement opportunities
   - Address usability concerns
   - Implement minor enhancements

## Open Questions

1. **API Reliability**: How reliable is the FootballWebPages API in practice? Are there rate limits or downtime periods?
   - Initial testing shows good reliability, but long-term monitoring is needed

2. **Data Completeness**: Does the API provide all necessary fixture information consistently?
   - API provides comprehensive fixture information including dates, times, venues, and competition details

3. **Calendar Client Behavior**: How quickly do different calendar applications sync with subscription updates?
   - To be determined during subscription testing

4. **Edge Cases**: How well does the implementation handle postponed or cancelled fixtures?
   - Implementation includes status handling for cancelled and postponed fixtures, but real-world testing is needed

## Current Blockers

1. **GitHub Repository**: Need to create the repository and configure GitHub Pages
   - Deployment guide created with step-by-step instructions

2. **Subscription Testing**: Need to verify calendar compatibility across platforms
   - Ready for testing once the public URL is established
