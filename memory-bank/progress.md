A detailed deployment guide has been created (DEPLOYMENT.md) with step-by-step instructions for completing these tasks, but we're encountering unexpected issues with GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions.

## Known Issues

1. **API Response Structure**
   - **Issue**: Complete API response structure confirmed with actual API call
   - **Impact**: Data processing logic has been updated to match the actual structure
   - **Status**: Resolved

2. **Calendar Compatibility**
   - **Issue**: Compatibility with all calendar applications not yet verified
   - **Impact**: May require format adjustments
   - **Status**: To be tested during implementation

3. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - **Issue**: Workflow files pushed to repository but not appearing in Actions tab
   - **Impact**: Cannot trigger automated updates
   - **Status**: Investigating - manual calendar generation completed as workaround

4. **GitHub Pages Configuration**
   - **Issue**: Pages configured but returning 404 error
   - **Impact**: Calendar not accessible via public URL
   - **Status**: Investigating

## Next Milestones
