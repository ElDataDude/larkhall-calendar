4. Click "Save"
5. Wait for the deployment to complete (this may take a few minutes)
6. Note the URL where your site is published (e.g., `https://[your-username].github.io/larkhall-calendar/`)

### 5. Update the Calendar URL in index.html

1. Edit the `index.html` file in your repository
2. Replace `https://[username].github.io/larkhall-calendar/fixtures.ics` with your actual URL:

## Troubleshooting

### Calendar Not Updating

- Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository to see if the workflow is running successfully
- Verify that the API key is correctly set up as a repository secret
- Check the workflow logs for any error messages

### Subscription Issues

If you need to make changes to the code or configuration:

1. Clone the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. The changes will be reflected in the deployed application
