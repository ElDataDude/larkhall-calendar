# Larkhall Athletic Fixtures Calendar - Project Intelligence

This file captures key insights, patterns, and preferences for the Larkhall Athletic Fixtures Calendar project. It serves as a learning journal to help maintain consistency and efficiency throughout development.

## Project Patterns

### Architecture Patterns

1. **Simple, Modular Design**
   - Keep components separate and focused on single responsibilities
   - Maintain clear interfaces between components
   - Prioritize readability and maintainability over complexity

2. **Automation First**
   - Automate all routine tasks
   - Use GitHub Actions for scheduled processes
   - Minimize manual intervention requirements

3. **Defensive Programming**
   - Assume API responses may be inconsistent
   - Implement robust error handling
   - Provide fallback mechanisms for failures

### Implementation Preferences

1. **Python Style**
   - Follow PEP 8 guidelines
   - Use type hints where beneficial
   - Prefer explicit over implicit

2. **Error Handling**
   - Use try/except blocks for external service calls
   - Log detailed error information
   - Implement retry mechanisms with backoff

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Test API interactions with mocked responses
   - Validate calendar output against RFC 5545
   - Verify end-to-end functionality with real subscriptions

## Critical Implementation Paths

### API Integration

1. **Authentication**
   - Use API key in request header
   - Keep key secure in environment variables
   - Never commit API key to repository

2. **Data Retrieval**
   - Handle pagination if present
   - Filter for relevant fixtures only
   - Process both home and away fixtures

### Calendar Generation

1. **Event Creation**
   - Include all essential fixture details
   - Format dates in UTC with timezone information
   - Set appropriate alarm/reminder properties

2. **File Management**
   - Generate complete file on each update
   - Validate file format before committing
   - Maintain consistent file location

## Known Challenges

1. **API Reliability**
   - FootballWebPages API availability unknown
   - May have rate limits or downtime
   - Need robust retry and fallback mechanisms

2. **Fixture Changes**
   - Football fixtures often change with little notice
   - Need to handle postponements and cancellations
   - Calendar must reflect latest information

3. **Calendar Client Compatibility**
   - Different calendar applications handle .ics differently
   - Need to test with major platforms
   - May need workarounds for specific clients

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (March 2025)

1. **Technology Stack**: Python with requests and icalendar libraries
   - Chosen for simplicity and strong library support
   - Alternatives considered: Node.js, PHP

2. **Hosting Platform**: GitHub Pages
   - Chosen for free, reliable hosting integrated with GitHub Actions
   - Alternatives considered: AWS S3, Netlify

3. **Update Frequency**: Daily via GitHub Actions
   - Chosen to balance timeliness with resource usage
   - Alternatives considered: Hourly, weekly

## Tool Usage Patterns

### GitHub

1. **Repository Structure**
   - Keep flat structure for simplicity
   - Use src/ directory for Python code
   - Store .ics file in root for easy access

2. **GitHub Actions**
   - Use scheduled workflows for automation
   - Store secrets securely
   - Enable manual trigger option

### Python Environment

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Use requirements.txt for dependencies
   - Pin specific versions for stability
   - Use virtual environment for development

2. **Local Development**
   - Use .env file for local environment variables
   - Test locally before pushing changes
   - Validate .ics output with calendar applications

## User Preferences

1. **Calendar Content**
   - Include essential fixture details only
   - Format event titles consistently
   - Set appropriate calendar metadata

2. **Subscription Process**
   - Make subscription URL easy to access
   - Provide clear instructions for different platforms
   - Ensure calendar name is descriptive

## Future Considerations

1. **Potential Enhancements**
   - Adding match results after games
   - Including additional team information
   - Supporting multiple teams or competitions

2. **Maintenance Priorities**
   - Reliability over new features
   - Backward compatibility
   - Documentation currency
